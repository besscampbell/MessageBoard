## Message Board API

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to GET all messages related to a specific group.
* As a user, I want to be able to POST messages to a specific group.
* As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all groups.
* As a user, I want to input date parameters and retrieve only messages posted during that timeframe.
* As a user, I want to be able to PUT and DELETE messages, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
